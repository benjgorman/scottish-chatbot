# Advanced Scottish Chat

Och aye! Welcome tae the **Advanced Scottish Chat** project. This wee app is a React-based chatbot wi' an Express backend. It's like havin' a blether wi' yer favorite Scottish pal, but noo it's on yer computer!

## Whit's Inside?

- **Frontend**: A React app livin' in the `basic-chat` folder. This is where the chatbot gets its charm an' good looks.
- **Backend**: An Express server hidin' in the `server` folder. It handles aw the serious business, like processin' yer chat nonsense.

## How Tae Run This Beast

Right, here's how tae get it up an' runnin'. Follow these steps like yer followin' a ceilidh dance:

### 1. Clone the Repo
First, grab the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjgorman/scottish-chat.git
cd advanced-scottish-chat
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ye'll need tae install the packages for both the frontend an' backend. Here's how:

```bash
# For the frontend
cd ./basic-chat
npm install

# For the backend
cd ./server
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Backend
Fire up the Express server:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
It'll be listenin' on `http://localhost:3001` unless ye've been messin' wi' the ports.

### 4. Start the Frontend
Now tae get the React app goin':
```bash
cd ../basic-chat
npm start
```
This should open up yer browser at `http://localhost:3000`. If it disnae, just type it in yersel'.

### 5. Chat Away!
Noo ye can have a guid wee chat wi' the bot. Ask it somethin' daft or just talk about the weather in Glasgow.
